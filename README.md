# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION MODEL

AIM: The aim was to identify the heart disease. But it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, and many other factors. Due to such constraints, scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for
predicting the disease.

METHOD : The dataset consists of 303 individuals data. There are 14 columns(features) in the dataset. With the analysis we will be able to establish the relation between different medical factors and heart disease and were able to establish certain patterns.

DATA EXPLORATION: 
Data exploration is an approach similar to initial data analysis, whereby a data analyst uses visual exploration to understand what is in a dataset and the characteristics of the data, rather than through traditional data management systems.These characteristics can include possible relationships amongst data elements or files/tables in the data.
Objective :
● Initial investigation on data
● To discover hidden patterns
● To make sense out of data
● To test hypothesis
● It is a good practice to try to understand data first and try to gatter insight from it
Methods :
● Univariate Visualization
● Bivariate Visualization


DATA PREPROCESSING:
Data preprocessing is crucial in any data mining process as they directly impact success rate of the project. ... Data is said to be unclean if it is missing attribute, attribute values, contain noise or outliers and duplicate or wrong data. Presence of any of these will degrade quality of the results.

Now we study two machine Learning algorithms to build an ef ective model:
1).Decision Tree Classifier - THIS DECISION CLASSIFIER MODEL HAS GIVEN US ACCURACY OF 75% ON TEST DATA
2).KNeighborsClassifier - THIS K-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFIER MODEL HAS GIVEN US ACCURACY OF 84% ON TEST DATA

CONCLUSION:
It is difficult to manually determine the odds of getting heart disease based on risk factors. However, machine learning techniques are useful to predict the output from existing data. We were able to establish relation between different medical factors and heart disease and were able to establish hidden patterns . We have proved in our project that KNN classifier method is better than the Decision Tree Classifier for our datase.
